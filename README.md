# python-challenge

**Background**
In this challenge, I used python to analyze the data from both data sets. I wrote a script for each respective file and learned how to use the commands "git add", "git commit -m """, and "git push" to push all of the files to github through GitBash. 

Collaboration with others:
> Spoke with Conner Dekok about his approach for the print statements at the end of each file and how he was storing his variables -- i.e. appending lists with information from each row of the csv.

> I used many of these sites to try and better understand list comprehension. I did not realize that multiple "for" arguments are able to be used, but I was able to get it working in PyBank/main.py.

Much of the code used in PyPoll was extremely similar to the vba projects: temporary variables that can be updated through the code, etc. One of the major differencces really comes with the lists and dictionaries for storing data.

**All other lines of code were generated from what we learned in class**
